FEEDBACK:

Nice clean implementation of extra credit portion!


Good handling of user's request to insert a new element out of bounds!


-0 When updating your list via the method insertAtIndex() in class CountryList, 
    how did you verify your implementation 
	if you did not output the current state of the list?



Extra Credit:
+3 implementation of insertAtIndex() method.
+1 clearly defined test cases for insertAtIndex() method.   
+1 successfully tested insertAtIndex() method.   


other comments:
In class CountryList consider keeping either getSize() or size() method 
	as they are doing the same thing.
	
-Bita.
